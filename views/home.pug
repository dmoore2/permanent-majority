  h1 Permanent Majority
  p.
    Social media has changed politics. Binaries in politics as we think we know them no longer exist, and traditional understanding of political parties and therefore their ideas is also now a relic of the past. People have nuanced, specific opinions about politics, and the two camps rarely satisfy the majority. Therefore, we need to tailor how we understand politics to a system that makes specific opinions the general, and gives everyone an equal platform to share with decision makers their views on the world. Otherwise, binary polls and the policies that are informed by them will continue to dissatisfy the public, and governance will become more difficult. We must change how we poll the people, in order to change the policies that change their lives.

      h2 Project Goal
      p This site is intended to illustrate the utility of our call center suite via a functional demo. Of course, only a subset of the features that will ultimately be built are included here. However, even as is, the demo is completely functional, ready to scale, and designed with the intention of concealing a reasonably complex architecture behind a simple interface.
